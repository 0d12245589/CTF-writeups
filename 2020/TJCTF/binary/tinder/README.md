## Solution

if we dissassemble the binary we see a cmp instruction that leads to the flag :

btw `var_C = 0`

and we see that it reads before the bio at `ebp-0x80` and then compares the integer at `ebp` with `0x0C0D3D00D`

so by playing around to find the exact offset which is `0x74`

I wrote a [script](https://github.com/0d12245589/CTF-writeups/raw/master/2020/TJCTF/binary/tinder/solve.py) using pwntools to get a match (I mean the flag)

```
tjctf{0v3rfl0w_0f_m4tch35}
```
