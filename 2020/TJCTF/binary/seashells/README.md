## Solution

first thing we do is disassemble the binary, we have to interesting functions :

![screenshot1](https://github.com/0d12245589/CTF-writeups/raw/master/2020/TJCTF/binary/seashells/images/screenshot1.png)
![screenshot2](https://github.com/0d12245589/CTF-writeups/raw/master/2020/TJCTF/binary/seashells/images/screenshot2.png)

we can see that the main function is using gets for input (which is a dumb move :P)

and also the shell function which is never called checks an argument then pops a shell

so we conclude that we can use ROP (since its a 64bit binary) to exploit it using this chain :

```
pop rdi
0xDEADCAFEBABEBEEF
shell
```

which is a very simple chain, I wrote a script to help automate the process : [solve.py](https://github.com/0d12245589/CTF-writeups/raw/master/2020/TJCTF/binary/seashells/solve.py)

tada :
```
tjctf{she_s3lls_se4_sh3ll5}
```

> P.S : had to do repeat the rop chain two times to make it work still don't know why XD
