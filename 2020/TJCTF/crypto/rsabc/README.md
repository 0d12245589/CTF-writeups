## Solution

hmmm I guess its a regular RSA and we don't need any hints because the numbers are small enough to factorize

so I used this handy dandy (website)[https://www.alpertron.com.ar/ECM.HTM] to factorize N : (it took me a couple minutes though)

```
p = 202049603951664548551555274464815496697
q = 285934543893985722871321330457714807993
```

and from there it's easy to decrypt the ciphertext, I used a python (script)[solve.py] to do that

```
tjctf{BOLm1QMWi3c}
```
